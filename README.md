# Human Detection in Videos and Audios

Fall 2023

Team members - Apoorva Saraswat, Krisna Lach, Matthew Weiner, Peter Tran, Ryan Baker, Xingyu Bian

## Goal

To build a model that detects humans in the video based on the video and audio and creates thumbnail of faces found in the video along with their timestamps to make it easier to find people.

## Utility

A law enforcement official can use our tool while procesing videos and view timestamps where specific people appeared in the video. This can save their time and make it easier for them to process videos.
